# Per-directory .htaccess for the /configuraciones application route.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# A real 'configuraciones/' directory exists on the filesystem.  On
# LiteSpeed / cPanel shared hosting, "Options -Indexes" (set in the parent
# .htaccess) is sometimes evaluated during the directory-resolution stage
# BEFORE mod_rewrite is allowed to run.  This causes the server to return
# HTTP 403 Forbidden even though:
#   - The parent .htaccess already declares "DirectoryIndex index.php", AND
#   - A valid index.php stub exists inside this directory.
#
# Adding this per-directory .htaccess ensures LiteSpeed reads and applies
# "DirectoryIndex index.php" while processing THIS directory specifically,
# which causes it to serve the stub file instead of returning 403.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not add RewriteEngine rules here – all URL routing is
# handled by the root index.php router.  Sub-paths such as
# /configuraciones/auditoria are NOT real directories and are therefore
# handled cleanly by the parent .htaccess RewriteRule.
